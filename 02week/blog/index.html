          <p>For Most people, finding a nice patio with great surrounds can be difficult.  The Salt Lick just south of Austin combines the perfect outdoor atmosphere with a wonderful seating area with thier Napa style location.  Perhaps my favorite aspect of this BBQ joint is thier onsite winery to pair with all the food.</p>

        <div class="h2"><h2>January 2018 Blog update: Black's BBQ</h2>
          <p>The ambience of Black's BBQ is quite special upon arrival.  From the moment you walk in the door, the smell of freshly sliced brisket and pork links take over your senses.  The only drawback of this establishment is choosing what to get because the presentation is incredible.</p>

        <div class="h2"><h2>December 2017 Blog update: Franklin's</h2>
          <p>At the holy grail of BBQ restaurants you need only patience, the line for the door at Franklin's can and will wrap around the block; and quite possibly to your parking spot down the street.  At this establishment you know you're in for a treat by the look of the place, it has an old timey feel with an out door grill that captures the attention of hungry consumers nearby.</p>
